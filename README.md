# Moon-Mechanic
I wanted to build a world with an interesting and particular background that would be understood by the player as you go, without being told outright. I thought of the idea of a world where the moon had to be switched out from time to time, like a lightbulb, if it were to get too dim. I felt like I could better achieve the effect and game that I wanted if I were to implement illustrations, so I used midjourney AI to create some different scenes for me, based off the artists Tom Gauld and Olivier Schrauwen. Overall, I had a pretty smooth process implementing interactivity and different scenes with the code, but it did get a little confusing as things started to stack up--which showed me the importance of naming things clearly. I think I could improve on the vaiability of the game, perhaps giving the player some option to fail or to interact with more things and go down a different path.
